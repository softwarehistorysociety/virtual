Dell Unix on Bochs/Qemu - Install Instructions
Antoni Sawicki <tenox@tenox.tc>
==============================================
 1. Create a HDD image, note there is no LBA support so make it smaller than 504 MB.
 2. Create second hard disk to emulate a tape device.
 3. Boot from boot.img swap to system.img and continute.
 4. Use option 3 for maintenance.
 5. Initialize both disks so the system has active VTOC:
    # dellsetup -a 0 1
    The system should have created /home2 on /dev/rdsk/1s1 - this is what we will
    use for tape emulation. 
    # umount /mnt/home2 
 6. Find out starting sector for disk 1 s1:
    # prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/1s0
    Now look for HOME ... starting sector: XXXX
    On my system it was 378 - remember this value
 7. Preserve partitions and vfstab files
    # cp /mnt/etc/* /tmp
 8. On the host system preload the tape file1 to the disk 1 slice 1
    On my system I did following (trans.img is ata0-slave):
    # losetup /dev/loop0 trans.img
    # dd if=DellSVR4/Factory/file1 of=/dev/loop0 bs=512 seek=378
    Remember to use your starting sector value instead 378
    If on Windows you can use Winhex to plant the file at offset.
 9. On the unix side extract the contents:
    # cd /mnt
    # cpio -icdmuDk < /dev/dsk/1s1
NOTE: at this point you have access to all "regular" unix commands!
10. Restore partitions and vfstab files
    # cp /tmp/* /mnt/etc
11. Dellsetup automatically used dsk/1s1 as /home2 
    # vi /mnt/etc/vfstab 
    remove the last line
12. Install boot
    # dellboot /mnt/etc/boot /dev/rdsk/0s0
13. Configure network 
    # /mnt/usr/sbin/setnodename -r /mnt
14. Clean up
    # cd /
    # sync
    # umount /mnt/home2
    # umount /mnt/home
    # umount /mnt/stand
    # umount /mnt
    # sync
15. Reboot / set boot to c
16. Boot from c and go through configuration steps
17. Preload file2 to the slice 1 - see #8
18. Install additional packages
    # pkgadd -d /dev/dsk/1s1
    all
19. The default mouse manager is not very happy about the bochs mouse. To use X11 you
    can enable serial mouse in bochs, then edit /usr/lib/X11/Xconfig, disable Xqueue
    and enable Microsoft mouse.
    # kill mouse mgr process
    # rm /etc/rc2.d/S25mse
    # startx
