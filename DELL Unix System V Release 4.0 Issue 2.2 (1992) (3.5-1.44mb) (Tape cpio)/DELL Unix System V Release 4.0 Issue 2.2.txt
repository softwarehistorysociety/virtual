DELL Unix System V Release 4.0 Issue 2.2
Released in 1992 by Dell Computer Corporation
For DELL AT386 PC compatible computers

Dell Unix, first introduced in 1989, was an adaptation of AT&T Unix
intended for Dell hardware. Although Dell Unix received much praise,
Dell found they could not reasonably support it on non-Dell hardware,
as many customers wanted, and in 1993 discontinued it.
